# AM10 Data Visualisation and Storytelling - Group 14 Project

## Topic Idea 1: Plastic Pollution

Chosen topic:
**Where does the plastic in our oceans come from?**

## Issues or questions that we would like to address

Within our analyses and visualisations we want to answer the following research questions:
**Which countries contribute the most to mismanaged plastic?
Progression of plastic pollution over the years
What are the main plastic pollution sources and how they have changed over the years?
How is most of our plastic disposed?**

## Source of the data we will be using

The source of data we will be using is the “Plastic Waste and Pollution by countries (2019)” dataset and the “Earth Challenge Integrated Data: Plastic Pollution (MLW, MDMAP, ICC) 2015-2018”. The dataset “2019 Plastic Waste and Pollution dataset” contains information of mismanaged plastic waste to ocean, plastic waste emitted to the ocean and waste exports per capita for year 2019 across 166 different countries. The database can be found from the link: https://ourworldindata.org/explorers/plastic-pollutionfacet=none&country=OWID_WRL~USA~CHN~IND~GBR~MYS~DEU&Metric=Mismanaged+waste&Per+capita=true&Share+of+world+total=false

The second dataset “Earth Challenge Integrated Data: Plastic Pollution (MLW, MDMAP, ICC) 2015-2018” is a 4-year cohort data that records the number of different types of plastic products found on shorelines across different regions. The dataset can be found below: https://globalearthchallenge.earthday.org/datasets/98631dc5bb9a4ea5a8f9c0b4ec433290_0/explore?location=3.139661%2C2.357206%2C2.01

Our analysis will be based on the above two datasets but additional data sources will be used to merge and combined into the final data.

## What statistical techniques do you think you may be using?

To analyse the trend of plastic pollution around the world, time series analysis is helpful in predicting the future situation and discovering key elements that environmental policies should focus on.
